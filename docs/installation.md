# Installation 

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress
3. Use the **Settings > NPR API** screen to configure the plugin. Begin by entering your API Key, then add your Push URL and Org ID. 

If you don't have an API Key or Org ID you can request them by [registering for an NPR account](http://www.npr.org/account/signup). 

The Push URL for the NPR Production API is `https://api.npr.org`. 

The Push URL for testing purposes is `https://api-s1.npr.org`.

The Pull URL for production should be fine for testing as well: `https://api.npr.org`
