# Pushing Stories to the NPR API

After you set up the WordPress NPR API Plugin, pushing stories to the NPR API couldn't be easier. In **Settings > NPR API > NPR Push Post Type** you can select what type of posts you want to push to the API. The default will be Post, meaning as you create and publish posts they will automatically be pushed to the NPR API. Or if you have a custom post type you want to reserve for stories pushed to the API, you can select this in the **NPR Push Post Type** setting, and only those posts will be pushed.
