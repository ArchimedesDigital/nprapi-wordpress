# Pushing Posts to NPR One 

You can easily push posts to the [NPR One mobile app](http://www.npr.org/about/products/npr-one/) in addition to the NPR API. 

After you've [set up the WordPress NPR API Plugin](settings.md) with your API Key and Org ID, you'll see a new checkbox in the Post Edit screen for "Send to NPR One":

The checkbox isn't selected by default. This allows you to push all your stories to the NPR API, but only selected stories to NPR One. If you want to push a post to NPR One, check the box and hit the Publish or Update button.
