# Pushing Posts to NPR One 

You can easily push posts to the [NPR One mobile app](http://www.npr.org/about/products/npr-one/) in addition to the NPR API. 

After you've set up the WordPress NPR API Plugin with your API Key and Org ID, you'll see a new checkbox in the Post Edit screen for "Send to NPR One":

The checkbox isn't selected by default so if you want the post to go to NPR One, check the box and hit the Publish or Update button. This allows you to push all your stories to the NPR API, but only select stories to NPR One.
