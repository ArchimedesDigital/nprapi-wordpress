Release Notes for 1.4

- Filters for shortCodes - We've now created a filter that will be used to alter any short codes that a plugin may own in a post before pushing 
    that post to the NPR API.  The filter npr_ds_shortcode_filter will fire before we remove short codes when we're pushing the post.  Each
    plugin that has any short codes it can alter should alter those short codes via this filter to something that's more HTML-friendly so that 
    other clients could possibly access that information.

- Bulk Push - From the post list page for you NPR Push post type you can now select multiple posts and using the bulk operation drop down
    on that page, push the selected posts to the NPR API.  This would be helpful for posts that have been living on a site before the
    NPR API plugin was installed and an admin wanted to push multiple posts.  Note that this will only push up to 20 posts at one time.
