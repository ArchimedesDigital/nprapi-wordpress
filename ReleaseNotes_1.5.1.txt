Multiple Bylines for pulled stories -  This fix came from Ryan Tainter at KERA.  Thanks Ryan.  When an API story has multiple
bylines, we will now populate a meta field npr_multi_byline with a pipe '|' deliminated list of names.  If the author also
has a link for thier byline then there'll be a tilda '~' separating the author's name and the link.  
An example of data for multiple bylines is :
   Ari Shapiro~http://www-s2.npr.org/people/2101154/ari-shapiro|kmoylan@npr.org|Tommy Writer
Here there are three authors for this story, Ari Shapiro (and his bio link), then "kmoylan@npr.org" and a third author "Tommy Writer".
Single author stories will not be changed.

Do not re-pull stories that are already in draft status - The get multi would repleatedly re-pull stories into draft mode if there is already a draft copy.
This fix will check for status=any when checking to see if a story already exists in the WP database.
