- Reversed the order of images and audio that are being pushed to the NPR API.  We're now sending them in the order the file was created.  

- Mapping of media credit and agency.  If you have a field that you are storing image credit and agency, you can now send these to the NPR API.  
  In making this change we needed to expose meta fields that begin with an underscore ('_').  So you may see more meta fields visable on the 
  mapping page.
  
- Multiple bylines are now being pushed to the NPR API if you use the plugin co-author-plus (http://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/stats/)
  We insert a byline row for each of the co-authors of a post when we push.  You can still use a custom byline field if you want to use that along
  with the co-authors plugin.
   
- Retrieved story dates -  Now when you retrieve a story from the NPR API the published date for WP will be the date from the <storyDate> field in
  the NPR API.  This will better allow stories to fall into their natural order when publishing from the Get Multi page.  It's always possible
  to edit the date by hand when pulling single stories from the NPR API.  Do remember though that you are contractually obligated to show the
  original date when rendering a story from the NPR API.
  
- Retrieved story order -  When you retrieve stories from the API, if you do not include a 'sort=' parameter in your query, we will insure that 
   the order of the stories is in reverse cron for any stories that have the same storyDate in the API.  Often some aggregate groups in the API
   will publish stories with the same storyDate.  Shows like Morning Edition do this often, and prior to this fix stories would appear to be 
   published in reverse order from what the API shows.  Now if you do not include 'sort=' in your query, the stories with the same time
   will be published in the same order as the API shows them.
    
- Configurable Cron interval -  When you use the Get Multi page, which fires off of wp-cron, you can now set the interval for the wp-cron to fire.
   This is on the Get Multi configuration page, and allows you to enter a number of minutes you want as your wp-cron interval.  If you enter any 
   thing that is not a number, or a number less than 1, we will resolve that to 60 minutes...because, well, that's a resonable interval, and 
   the wp-cron doesn't understand 'every now and then' as an interval.  
   
- Images from crops -  In earlier versions of the plugin we would pull down the image from the URL in <image src=>.  Well, seems that a lot of those 
  images were small, with ?s=12 in the URL, or thumbnails.  So now we're bringing down any bigger versions that we can find.  We'll look for the 
  following elements under <image> tags.  In order <enlargement>, <crop type=enlargement>, <crop type=standard>, and then get <image src=> if those
  other elements do not exist.  This should help with getting bigger images.  If you need a smaller image, just theme the bigger one.
