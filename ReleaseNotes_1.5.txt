- Reversed the order of images and audio that are being pushed to the NPR API.  We're now sending them in the order the file was created.  

- Mapping of media credit and agency.  If you have a field that you are storing image credit and agency, you can now send these to the NPR API.  
  In making this change we needed to expose meta fields that begin with an underscore ('_').  So you may see more meta fields visable on the 
  mapping page.
  
- Multiple bylines are now being pushed to the NPR API if you use the plugin co-author-plus (http://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/stats/)
  We insert a byline row for each of the co-authors of a post when we push.  You can still use a custom byline field if you want to use that along
  with the co-authors plugin.
   
- Retrieved story dates -  Now when you retrieve a story from the NPR API the published date for WP will be the date from the <storyDate> field in
  the NPR API.  This will better allow stories to fall into their natural order when publishing from the Get Multi page.  It's always possible
  to edit the date by hand when pulling single stories from the NPR API.  Do remember though that you are contractually obligated to show the
  original date when rendering a story from the NPR API.
